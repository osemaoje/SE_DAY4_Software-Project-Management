Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is iterative and flexible, offering faster delivery and better adaptability. It’s ideal for projects with evolving requirements. Waterfall is linear and structured, providing clear milestones but less flexibility for change. Agile is more adaptable mor like LEGO, while Waterfall is better for well-defined projects.

In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is better for projects with uncertain or evolving requirements, such as software development and startups. Waterfall suits projects with fixed requirements, like construction or manufacturing.

What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods include continuous testing, code reviews, automated testing, and regular feedback loops. High standards ensure reliability, customer satisfaction, and long-term success.

How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining the scope ensures clear objectives, minimizing scope creep. A WBS breaks down tasks into manageable components, helping with resource allocation and task prioritization.

What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
A detailed project schedule helps track progress, allocate resources, and set milestones. Gantt charts visually represent timelines, task dependencies, and completion rates.
